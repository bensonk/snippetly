h1. Snippetly

Snippetly is a tool to let you share snippets of text.  Initially, everything
will be public, but we'll eventually add support for sharing with groups of
friends or with individuals.  The intention is to use it primarily for moving
bits of text around on the command line.  It is not twitter, it is not gist,
and it is not another social network.
